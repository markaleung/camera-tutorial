# Aperture  
  
## Definition  
Smaller number = bigger hole, more light, more blur  
Bigger number = smaller hole, less light. less blur  
  
## Tips  
1.8 for people + blurry background  
6-8 35mm, 4-5 APS-C, 3-4 M43 for food, landscape  
11-16 35mm, 7-11 APS-C, 6-8 M43 for people + sharp background  
Adjust aperture to taste if background is too blurry/not blurry enough  
  
# Shutter Speed  
  
## Tips - Situations  
1/60 or faster for moving subjects  
1/200 or faster for sports  
1/10 or slower for waterfalls  
As slow as you like for still subjects  
Use shutter speed priority when handheld at night, to maintain shutter speed when it is too dark  
  
## Tips - Technical

4/35mm-focal-length or faster when image stabilised  
As slow as you like when tripod mounted

## ISO Tips (How to reduce noise from high ISO)  
Shoot in brighter environments (flash)  
Increase aperture width (wider aperture lenses)  
Reduce shutter speed (image stabilisation or tripod)  
Reduce noise at same ISO (bigger sensor or newer camera)  
  
## Exposure Compensation Tips  
Increase for white background e.g. snow, ice skating
