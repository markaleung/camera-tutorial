# Aperture Tips  
1.8 for people + blurry background (requires prime lens)  
6-8 for food, landscapes (3-4 for M43, 4-5 for APS-C)  
8-22 for people + sharp background (4-11 for M43, 5-15 for APS-C)  
  
# Shutter Speed Tips  
faster than 1/35mm focal length when handheld (camera default)  
faster than 4/35mm focal length when image stabilised  
as slow as you like when tripod mounted  
faster than 1/60 for moving people  
faster than 1/200 for sports  
slower than 1/10 for waterfalls  
as slow as you like for still landscapes  
Use shutter speed priority for night handheld, to prevent low shutter speed when camera runs out of ISO  
  
# ISO Tips (How to make it lower)  
Shoot in brighter environments (might require flash)  
Increase aperture width (might require wider aperture lenses)  
Reduce shutter speed (might require image stabilisation or tripod)  
  
# Exposure Compensation Tips  
Increase for white background e.g. snow, ice skating  
Decrease for black background e.g. spotlight
