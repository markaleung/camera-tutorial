## Aperture  
Big hole, small number, more light, more blur  
Small hole, big number, less light. less blur  
  
## Aperture Tips  
1.8 for people + blurry background  
6-8 35mm, 4-5 APS-C, 3-4 M43 for food, landscape  
11-16 35mm, 7-11 APS-C, 6-8 M43 for people + sharp background

1/35mm-focal-length or faster when handheld (camera default)  
4/35mm-focal-length or faster when image stabilised  
As slow as you like when tripod mounted  
Use shutter speed priority when handheld at night, to maintain shutter speed when it is too dark

1/60 or faster for moving subjects  
1/200 or faster for sports  
1/10 or slower for waterfalls  
As slow as you like for still subjects  
  
## ISO Tips (How to reduce noise from high ISO)  
Shoot in brighter environments (might require flash)  
Increase aperture width (might require wider aperture lenses)  
Reduce shutter speed (might require image stabilisation or tripod)  
Reduce noise at same ISO (might require bigger sensor or newer camera)  
  
## Exposure Compensation Tips  
Increase for white background e.g. snow, ice skating
