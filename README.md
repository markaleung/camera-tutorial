# Shooting modes  
  
## Sunny  
P normally  
A for blurrier background  
S for extra fast or slow  
Minimum ISO for stabilised when SS is faster than 4/35mm-focal-length  
  
## Dark  
S normally  
M for sharper background  
Auto ISO  
  
# Aperture  
  
## Definition  
Smaller number = bigger hole, more light, more blur  
Bigger number = smaller hole, less light. less blur  
  
## Tips  
1.8 for people + blurry background  
8 35mm, 5 APS-C, 4 M43 for food  
11-22 35mm, 7.1-14 APS-C, 5.6-11 M43 for people + sharp background  
Any aperture for landscape  
Adjust to taste if background is too blurry/not blurry enough  
  
# Shutter Speed  
  
## Tips - Situations  
1/60 or faster for moving subjects

1/35mm-focal-length or faster for unstabilised  
As slow as you like for tripod

## ISO Tips (How to reduce noise from high ISO)  
Shoot in brighter environments (flash)  
Wider aperture (faster lenses)  
Slow shutter speed (image stabilisation or tripod)  
Less noise at same ISO (bigger sensor or newer camera)  
  
## Exposure Compensation Tips  
Increase for white background e.g. snow, ice skating  
Decrease for black background e.g. spotlight
