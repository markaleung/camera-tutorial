# Camera Tips  
  
## Aperture Tips  
1.8 for people + blurry background  
6-8 35mm, 4-5 APS-C, 3-4 M43 for food and small objects  
8-14 35mm, 5-9 APS-C, 4-7 M43 for landscape  
14-22 35mm, 9-15 APS-C, 7-11 M43 for people + sharp background  
  
## Shutter Speed Tips  
faster than 1/35mm focal length when handheld (camera default)  
faster than 4/35mm focal length when image stabilised  
as slow as you like when tripod mounted  
faster than 1/60 for moving people  
faster than 1/200 for sports  
slower than 1/10 for waterfalls  
as slow as you like for still landscapes  
Use shutter speed priority when handheld at night, to maintain shutter speed when camera runs out of ISO  
  
## ISO Tips (How to reduce noise from high ISO)  
Shoot in brighter environments (might require flash)  
Increase aperture width (might require wider aperture lenses)  
Reduce shutter speed (might require image stabilisation or tripod)  
Reduce noise at same ISO (might require bigger sensor or newer camera)  
  
## Exposure Compensation Tips  
Increase for white background e.g. snow, ice skating  
Decrease for black background e.g. spotlight
