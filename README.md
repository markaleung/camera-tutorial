This tutorial explains how to use the basic functions on a camera.  
It covers the following topics.  
__Exposure__: Aperture, Shutter Speed, ISO, Compensation, Exposure Value  
__Features__: Autofocus, Flash, Image Stabilisation, White Balance  
__Questions__: Bigger Sensor, Depth of Field, Low light  
__Lenses__: Prime Lenses, Zoom Lenses, Crop Factor  
  
# Exposure  
  
## Definition  
__Aperture__: Focal length / hole diameter, aka F number  
__Shutter Speed__: Time that sensor is exposed to light (1/n seconds)  
__ISO__: Amplification of signal  
__Compensation__: Brightness of photo  
  
## One Stop Brighter (Doubling of light)  
__Aperture__: wider hole, depth of field decreases, /sqrt(2)  
__Shutter Speed__: longer time, motion blur increases, x2  
__ISO__: more amplification, noise increases, x2  
__Compensation__: photo gets brighter, +1  
  
## Tips  
__Aperture__: 3-5 for food/poster/landscape, widest for people  
__Shutter Speed__: 1/300 for sports, 1/60 for night, auto (1/focal length) otherwise  
__ISO__: Auto, as low as possible  
__Compensation__: high for ice/snow, very low for spotlight, 0 otherwise  
  
## Exposure Value  
[Exposure Value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_value) = Brightness of Scene = Camera Settings  
__Formula__: log2(aperture^2^) - log2(shutter) - log2(iso / 100) + compensation  
__Range__: 0 (night) to 16 (sun), Indoors is 3 to 8  
  
# Features  
  
## Autofocus  
__Single__: Focuses when button is pressed, still subjects  
__Continuous__: Changes focus as scene changes, moving subjects  
__Automatic__: Switches between single and continuous automatically  
__Face__: Detects faces, good for people  
__Tracking__: Follows object around the picture, moving subjects  
__Touch__: Select what you want to focus on  
  
## Flash  
Flash is difficult to use well  
On camera flash is especially bad because it's too close to the lens  
Off camera or bounce flash is better, but requires extra equipment  
__Tip__: Don't use flash unless you know what you're doing  
  
## Image Stabilisation  
Reduces shutter speed by 2-3 stops  
e.g. 400mm: 1/400 -> 1/100 to 1/50  
Shutter speed must be set manually  
  
## White Balance  
White balance must match [colour temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_temperature) of environment  
__Blue to yellow__: Outdoor shade > cloud > sun/flash > fluorescent > light bulb  
__Tip__: Use auto unless it looks bad  
  
  
# Questions  
  
## Bigger Sensor - Tradeoffs  
Shallower depth of field at same aperture  
Less noise at same ISO  
Higher maximum ISO  
Heavier and bigger  
More expensive  
  
## Depth of Field - How to Reduce?  
Wider aperture  
Bigger sensor  
Closer to subject  
Longer focal length (technically [telephoto distortion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_distortion_(photography)))  
  
## Low Light - How to Improve?  
Wider aperture lens  
Image stabilisation -> slower shutter speed  
Newer/bigger sensor -> higher ISO  
  
# Lenses  
  
## Prime Lenses - Tradeoffs  
No zoom  
Bigger aperture (1.4-2.8 vs 2.8-5.6)  
Better image quality  
Lighter and smaller  
Cheaper  
  
## Types of Prime Lenses  
__Normal__: 35mm/50mm, general use  
__Portrait__: 85mm, portraits  
__Macro__: focal length varies, very small objects  
  
## Types of Zoom Lenses  
__Wide__: 15-35mm, landscapes  
__Standard__: 24-70mm, general use  
__Telephoto__: 70-300mm, sports, concerts  
__Superzoom__: 28-300mm  
  
## Crop Factor  
For small sensors, focal length must be scaled up  
__Micro Four Thirds__: 2x e.g. 12-35mm => 24-70mm  
__Canon APS-C__: 1.6x e.g. 15-45mm => 24-72mm  
__Other APS-C__: 1.5x e.g. 16-50mm => 24-75mm
