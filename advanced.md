# camera-tutorial  
This tutorial explains how to use the basic functions on a camera.  
It covers the following topics.  
__Exposure__: Aperture, Shutter Speed, ISO, Compensation, Exposure Value  
__Features__: Autofocus, Flash, Image Stabilisation, White Balance  
__Questions__: Bigger Sensor, Blurred Background  
__Lenses__: Prime Lenses, Zoom Lenses, Crop Factor  
  
# Exposure  
  
## Definition  
[__Aperture__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aperture#In_photography): Focal length / hole diameter, aka F number  
[__Shutter Speed__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutter_speed): Time that sensor is exposed to light (1/n seconds)  
__ISO__: Amplification of signal  
__Compensation__: Brightness of photo  
  
## One Stop Brighter (Doubling of light)  
__Aperture__: wider hole, depth of field decreases, /sqrt(2)  
__Shutter Speed__: longer time, motion blur increases, x2  
__ISO__: more amplification, noise increases, x2  
__Compensation__: photo gets brighter, +1  
  
## Exposure Value  
[Exposure Value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_value) = Brightness of Scene = Camera Settings  
__Formula__: log2(aperture^2^) - log2(shutter) - log2(iso / 100) + compensation  
__Range__: 0 (night) to 16 (sun), Indoors is 3 to 8  
  
# Features  
  
## Autofocus  
__Single__: Focuses once when button is pressed, still subjects  
__Continuous__: Focuses continuously while button is held down, moving subjects  
__Automatic__: Switches between single and continuous automatically  
__Face__: Detects faces, good for people  
__Tracking__: Follows object around the picture, moving subjects  
__Touch__: Select what you want to focus on  
  
## Flash  
On camera flash is bad because it's close to the camera and harsh  
Off camera/bounce flash and diffusers/reflectors are good, but require extra equipment and knowledge  
__Tip__: Don't use on camera flash  
  
## Image Stabilisation  
Reduces shutter speed by 2-3 stops  
1/focal length -> 4-8/focal length  
e.g. 400mm: 1/400 -> 1/100 to 1/50  
Must reduce shutter speed manually  
__Tip__: Reduce shutter speed for telephoto lenses always, wide lenses when subject is still  
  
## White Balance  
White balance must match [colour temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_temperature) of environment  
__Blue to yellow__: Outdoor shade > cloud > sun/flash > fluorescent > light bulb  
__Tip__: Use auto unless it looks bad  
  
# Questions  
  
## Bigger Sensor - Tradeoffs  
Shallower depth of field at same aperture  
Less noise at same ISO  
Higher maximum ISO  
Heavier and bigger  
More expensive  
  
## Blurred Background/Shallow Depth of Field - How to Increase?  
Wider aperture lens  
Bigger sensor  
Closer subject  
Longer focal length (technically [telephoto distortion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_distortion_(photography)))  
  
# Lenses  
  
## Prime Lenses - Tradeoffs  
No zoom  
Bigger aperture (1.4-2.8 vs 2.8-5.6)  
Better image quality  
Lighter and smaller  
Cheaper  
  
## Types of Prime Lenses  
__Fisheye__: 8mm/16mm, circular/full frame fisheye  
__Wide__: 16mm/24mm, landscapes  
__Normal__: 35mm/50mm, general use  
__Macro__: focal length varies, very small objects  
__Portrait__: 85mm, portraits  
  
## Types of Zoom Lenses  
__Wide__: 15-35mm, landscapes  
__Standard__: 24-70mm, general use  
__Telephoto__: 70-300mm, sports, concerts  
__Supertelephoto__: 150-600mm, birding  
  
## Priority  
First: Standard, Normal,   
Second: Wide, Telephoto,   
Specialised: Portrait, Macro, Fisheye, Supertelephoto,   
  
## Crop Factor  
For small sensors, focal length must be scaled up  
__Micro Four Thirds__: 2x e.g. 12-35mm -> 24-70mm  
__Canon APS-C__: 1.6x e.g. 15-45mm -> 24-72mm  
__Other APS-C__: 1.5x e.g. 16-50mm -> 24-75mm
